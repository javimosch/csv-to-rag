## Scripts Descriptions

This document describes the purpose of each JavaScript file in the `scripts/` directory.

### `bundle.js`
This script uses Deno to bundle all the JavaScript files located in the `scripts/deno-ui/app` directory into a single file named `app-bundle.js`. This is likely done for optimization purposes in a production environment.

### `clear-db.js`
This script is used to clear data from both the Pinecone vector database and the MongoDB database. It prompts the user for confirmation before proceeding with the data deletion.

### `deno-ui.js`
This script is a Deno application that serves a user interface. It handles starting and stopping a backend process (likely a Node.js server) and serves static files for the UI. It also manages user authentication for accessing the UI.

### `mysql-schemas-to-csv.js`
This script connects to a MySQL database and extracts schema information for specified tables. The extracted information includes column names, the Data Definition Language (DDL) for creating the tables, and details about foreign keys and indexes. This information is then written to a CSV file, which can be useful for documentation or analysis purposes.
